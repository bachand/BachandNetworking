# Changelog

## Next

We [explicitly specify the platforms](https://github.com/bachand/BachandNetworking/pull/3) that we support and we [build those platforms in
CI](https://github.com/bachand/BachandNetworking/pull/5). We've [added a `HTTPResponse`](https://github.com/bachand/BachandNetworking/pull/6) to
the public API. `HTTPResponse` is value type. We've added method to create a type-erased publisher that returns this type if provided with a HTTPS URL.
